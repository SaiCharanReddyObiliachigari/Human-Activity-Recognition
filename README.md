# Human-Activity-Recognition
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
Performed different Classification Models and Linear SVC gave the best accuracy followed by Logistic Regression
1. Logistic Regression with Grid Search
2. Linear SVC with GridSearch
3. Kernel SVM with GridSearch
4. Decision Trees with GridSearchCV
5. Random Forest Classifier with GridSearch
6. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees With GridSearch
7. Comparing all models
